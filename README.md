# K8s Playground Env Setup

> :warning: **Currently only supported for macOS**.

A Zsh script that installs and sets up [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), and deploys [Google's Online Boutique microservices](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) to it.

## Getting started
Clone this repo to a convenient location, go to the root of it, and make the *ob_setup.sh* script executable with the following command:
```console
$ chmod +x ob_setup.sh
```
Then execute it:
```console
$ ./ob_setup.sh
```

The whole process can take up to 30 minutes.
